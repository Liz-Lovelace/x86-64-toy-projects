registers:
rax = register accumulator extended   (syscall number)
rdi = register destination index      (arg 0)
rsi = register source index           (arg 1)
rdx = register data extended          (arg 2)

r8 through r15 - These are the "safest" for your own data since they don't have special purposes
rbx - Good for general storage (callee-saved, so preserved across function calls)

Use with some caution:
rax - Return values, also used for syscall numbers
rcx - Sometimes used for loop counters
rdx - Often used for additional parameters or multiplication/division

Avoid or use carefully:
rsp - Stack pointer (don't mess with this unless you know what you're doing!)
rbp - Base pointer (often used for stack frames)
rdi, rsi - Used for syscall parameters (1st and 2nd arguments)
r10, r11 - Can be modified by syscalls
